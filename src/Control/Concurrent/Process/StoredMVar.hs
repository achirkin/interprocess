--   This module is an adaptation of `Control.Concurrent.MVar` to an
--   interprocess communication (IPC).
--   The IPC setting implies a few changes to the interface.
--
--   1. `StoredMVar` resides in a shared memory region.
--
--   2. We use `Storable` instance to serialize and deserialize a value.
--
--   3. Point (2) implies the value is always fully evaluated before being stored.
--
--   4. Scheduling is done by OS, thus the module does not guarantee FIFO order.
--
--   5. Using `StoredMVar` is only safe if `Storable` instance for its content
--      is correct and `peek` does not throw exceptions.
--      If `peek` throws an exception inside `takeMVar` or `swapMVar`,
--      the original content of `StoredMVar` is not restored

-- | An 'StoredMVar' is a synchronising variable, used
--   for communication between concurrent processes or threads.
--   It can be thought of as a a box, which may be empty or full.
--
--   @StoredMVar@ tries to mimic vanilla `MVar`, though it behaves quite differently.
--   It uses `Storable` instance to make the value accessible in different memory spaces.
--   Thus, the content of @StoredMVar@ is forced to be fully evaluated and serialized.
